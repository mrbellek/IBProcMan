# IBProcMan (Itty Bitty Process Manager) #

A standalone version of the little process manager included in HijackThis (Misc Tools section). Shows full paths to processes, optionally shows DLLs loaded by processes. Can save the process list (and dll list) to file, as well as copy it to the clipboard. Compatible with at least Windows 98, 98SE, ME, 2000, XP and newer. Very useful for cleaning up systems infected with trojans or viruses that kill antivirus and antispyware programs.
